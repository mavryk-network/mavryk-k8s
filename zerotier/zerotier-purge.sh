# Helper script to clean up stale ip's/members in your Zerotier network. The
# list grows as you spin up and down more and more chains during development.
# You eventually get to a point where Zerotier warns you on their site about the
# number of nodes you have on their free plan. Zerotier's site does not provide
# a way to bulk delete members. Please use at your own risk.

# See the 'COMMENT' below for the structure of a member from the
# https://my.zerotier.com/api/network/$ZT_NET/member/$node_id endpoint.

# You can use jq to filter by any field. Your jq filter needs to return a list
# of "nodeId".

# Filter example: Delete all offline nodes
# | jq -r '.[] | select(.online == false) | .nodeId' \
